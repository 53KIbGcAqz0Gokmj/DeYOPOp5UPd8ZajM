The profit realization strategy typically involves weekly, monthly and quarterly performance of stocks we buy or hold.

Set of portfolio companies trading data from emerging markets including 2020 Q1-Q2-Q3-Q4 2021 Q1 stock prices. Each market's operating days varies based on the country of the company and the market the stocks are exchanged. Predict with the 2021 Q1 data.

# Goal(s):

* Predict stock price valuations on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

* Maximize capital returns, minimize losses.
* Ideally a loss should never happen. Minimize HOLD period.
* Evaluate on the basis of capital returns. Use Bollinger Bands to measure the system effectiveness.
